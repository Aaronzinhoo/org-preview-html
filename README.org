* What is org-preview-html-mode

org-preview-html-mode is an Emacs minor mode for org mode that
automatically uses the built-in eww browser to preview the current org
file. The preview is updated every time the org file is saved.

* Installation

This package is not (yet) in MELPA.

You need to download it and place the org-preview-html.el file in a
directory on your emacs load path and require it.

The recommended, fully OS independent way to include a directory to
your load path is to use this code:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path
               (concat user-emacs-directory
                       (convert-standard-filename "elisp/")))
#+END_SRC

* Usage

Open an org file and execute =M-x org-preview-html-mode=. An eww preview
window is shown next to the org file.

Then every time the org file saved, the eww buffer is updated.
